# Corrie Butler's Development Portfolio

This website showcases the Web Development work of Corrie Butler. It includes links to existing pages programmed, a resume, and an about section for Corrie Butler. It is completely mobile responsive for any screen viewing.
Calculator and Pastel Puzzles are placeholders for future work. The links are not to actual work and will be replaced when work can be supplemented.
